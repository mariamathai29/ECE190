# Park Pal: A Novel Parking Guidance System
Group Members: Steve Joshua, Leo Mendoza, Maria Mathai

Our ECE 198 design project is Park Pal, a parking alignment system. The design theme for this iteration of the course was 'Communication', requiring all projects to involve communication between two STM32 NUCLEO-F401RE boards over a distance of one metre. 

Our final course grade was a 94 :)
